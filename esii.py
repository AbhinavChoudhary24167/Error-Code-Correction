"""Environmental Sustainability Improvement Index (ESII).

This module provides helpers to compute the ESII given reliability
improvements and carbon cost components.  The ESII is defined as the ratio of
failure rate improvement to the total carbon footprint associated with the
technique.  In addition to the main :func:`compute_esii` routine the module
offers utilities for deriving embodied-carbon terms from hardware properties.

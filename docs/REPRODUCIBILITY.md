# Reproducibility

## Level 1: reviewer smoke path

From the repository root, in a Python 3.10–3.12 environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make reviewer-smoke
```

Expected outcome: `ARTIFACT_CHECK_PASS`, a passing Hsiao verification report, deterministic seeded simulator JSON, and passing targeted tests. Outputs print to the terminal; no physical tool is used.

## Level 2: complete software validation

Prerequisites: Level 1 plus GNU Make and a C++17 compiler.

```bash
make
make test
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/build_documentation.py --check
```

`make` emits native binaries and object/dependency files in the repository root. They are ignored and removable with `make clean`. Pytest uses temporary directories outside the tracked fixture tree. If the platform has multiple MinGW runtimes, correct `PATH` until `python eccsim.py doctor --strict` passes.

## Level 3: campaign evidence audit or physical rerun

Audit first: read the campaign README, status, run manifest, validation results, hashes, and preserved logs. Package validation scripts may be run without allocating a new physical campaign.

A physical rerun requires the exact or explicitly migrated container/tool/PDK/library environment, sufficient storage and runtime, and a new campaign identity. Do not overwrite frozen evidence. The completed v3.3 campaign had a single 54,000-second deadline and is not resumable as a fresh budget.

## Determinism and provenance

Software workflows record fixed seeds where randomness is intentional. Evidence packages bind inputs, repository commits, tool versions, commands, output hashes, and qualification states. Historical absolute paths document where a job ran; they are not installation defaults.

Exact regeneration can still differ when compiler, solver, standard-library, EDA, or PDK identities differ. Treat a changed hash as a result to investigate, not something to rewrite silently.

## Expected failure modes

- Optional RTL/EDA tools absent: relevant checks skip or remain unavailable.
- Mixed Windows compiler/runtime DLLs: native executable launch may fail; align `PATH`.
- OpenRAM timeout: the retained attempt is intentionally partial, not a failed artifact check.
- Physical run lacks macro data, activity, or signoff: retain null/block status.
- Documentation regeneration changes frozen files: review the diff and never reseal historical evidence casually.

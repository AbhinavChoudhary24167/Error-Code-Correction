"""Knee point detection utilities.

This module provides a deterministic and normalised knee point finder based
on the maximum perpendicular distance criterion.  Points are first normalised
to the ``[0, 1]`` range on each axis.  The knee is then chosen as the point
furthest from the line joining the extreme points.  The extreme points are
never selected as the knee which makes the method robust against small
perturbations of the frontier.

The implementation is intentionally lightâ€‘weight and has no dependencies
outside the standard library.
